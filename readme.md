# KPF Qt (for Linux)

**I am currently working on a cross-platform KOTOR Savegame Editor clone/remake. Until then, this project will be put on hold and only bugfixes will be dealt with.**

## About

This is a fork of the KotOR PathFinder originally hosted on [the GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/kotorsge-team/kpf-qt).

Unlike the upstream version, this version aims to only support Linux (simply because I don't have a Windows machine to test on). Therefore, all Windows specific code has been removed.

## Requirements - Linux

### Qt5 install Arch

$ sudo pacman -S qt5-base qt5-webkit

### Qt5 install other linux

[Qt Creator (Open Source Edition)](http://www.qt.io/download/)

## Running

Linux requires installing the Qt framework. v5.4+ is required. Just use the link above, or run the command under Arch if you're an Arch user.
